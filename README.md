I would like to tell you a story about this project. To me, working on Web Development never had been possible. I studied engineering at the university, but that forced me to keep myself in a strict educational system without opportunities to taste, learn, and succeed in doing something I was passionate about ...

I love the web since I remember and recently decided to enroll myself in a software development program.

In the beginning, I felt unconfident about web technologies. However, I was able to keep calm while constantly repeated myself the phrase "practice makes perfect" and with a little extra effort, everything became a whole different story.

This project helped me improve my skills in a variety of **programming languages** (HTML, CSS, Markdown) and **technologies** (Responsive Web Design, Browsers Developer Tools, Git and GitHub), among **others** (JavaScript, SSH, Graphic Design.)

I hope you like my **Google homepage** since it is one of my greatest accomplishments. Thank you for visiting my profile.
